## 📦 File Structure

```bash
passwordx/
│
├── index.html    # The main HTML file
├── style.css     # The CSS file for styling
└── script.js     # JavaScript logic for managing the form and local storage
```

## 👨‍💻 Usage

1. **Open PasswordX** in your browser.
2. **Enter website credentials** in the provided form.
3. **Click "Save"** to store the credentials securely in local storage.
4. **View your saved passwords** in the table below the form.
5. Use the **"Show Password"** checkbox to reveal or hide passwords as needed.

## 🛡️ Security

- PasswordX uses the browser's local storage, ensuring that your data never leaves your device.
- While local storage offers convenience, please be cautious of using this on shared or public computers.
- For enhanced security, consider using browser extensions that encrypt local storage.

## 🎨 Styling

PasswordX has a clean, modern interface, using the **Roboto Serif** font to ensure readability. The input fields are designed with a minimalistic look, and the table uses flexbox for password visibility toggles.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- **Encryption**: Encrypt passwords stored in local storage for enhanced security.
- **Export/Import Functionality**: Allow users to export and import their password list.
- **Authentication**: Add basic authentication (like a master password) to access the stored passwords.
